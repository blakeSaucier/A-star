Built in Eclipse with Java 8.

To run, execute the main() function in Start.java. Twenty vertex pairs will be generated, with their shorest path distance and the number of vertices visited for both Dijkstra's and A-star being displayed in the output. At the end, a comparison for the speedup gained by using A-Star is displayed in the output.
